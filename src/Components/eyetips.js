                 <h3>What To DO and What NOT To Do When It Comes To Eyeshadow!!</h3>
                 1. Always Use A Primer<br></br>
                 Your main goal is to make sure that we have a clear and smooth skin before applying eyeshadow.<br></br>
                 2. Know Your Transition Shades<br></br>
                 Never use a densely hard brush to apply an eyeshadow in your crease.
                 Do not start off with a dark shadow, this will make it look very harsh.<br></br>
                 3. Add Dimension<br></br>
                 Matte eyeshadows with darker shade will help us achieve dimension.
                 Use a small precision brush that is tapered on the end.<br></br>
                 4. Use Your Blending Brush Correctly<br></br>
                 Do not use a densely packed and dome-shaped brush.
                 Don't hold the brush too close to the handle as it will make it difficult for you to blend.<br></br>
                 5. Pay Attention To Your Lower Lashline<br></br>
                 Use a lighter color on your lower lash line.
                 Many women are tempted to use a darker line of shadow on their lower lash line, but that just tends to create a harsh look.
                 Instead, opt for a little lighter color than the one you are wearing on your upper lids.<br></br>
                 6. Highlighting<br></br>
                 Too much product and too much glittery is a No-no!
                 Use a matte tone color to create highlight and transition.<br></br>
                 7. Setting Makeup<br></br>
                 Always do your eye shadows before you set your face makeup.<br></br>
                 8. The Final Finish<br></br>
                 Finish it up with some nice waterproof, smudge-proof eyeliner.
